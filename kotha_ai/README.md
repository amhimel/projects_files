Kotha AI is a voice-enabled smart assistant built with Flutter.
Users can speak naturally, and the app responds with contextual information such as weather, answers, and general assistance.
It features speech-to-text, text-to-speech, real-time weather data, and smooth animated UI screens.

## 📝 How It Works
1️⃣ Voice Capture
- User taps mic → STT starts → spoken words convert to text.

2️⃣ AI Processing
- Text is sent to logic/AI handler → generates a response.

3️⃣ Weather Handling
- If query involves weather:
- Location permission appears
- App fetches lat/lon
- Weather API returns temperature, humidity, wind, etc.

4️⃣ Display Response
- Neumorphic card updates with weather or conversational text.

5️⃣ Voice Output
- TTS speaks the result back.
